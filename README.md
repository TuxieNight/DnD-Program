# D&D Program
Riley Howardsmith and Peyton Howardsmith created this program in 11th grade of high school and worked on it over the summer. We were inspired to make this game by our first D&D experience. At the time that we made this game, we were not too experienced in D&D and had to research some of the rules.
<br><br>
Some things we would do if we were to continue working on this project:
<ol>
  <li>Change the UI so that when a player is asked to make a choice, they can select it from a drop-down menu instead of typing it.</li>
  <li>Add more battles before the game ends.</li>
  <li>Make rolling dice more fun. For example, instead of just calculating the initiative, have the player click a button so they feel as though they "rolled" the dice.</li>
  <li>Add imagery to make it more aesthetically pleasing.</li>
</ol>
